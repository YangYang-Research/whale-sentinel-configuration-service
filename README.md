This module is a critical component of the Whale Sentinel (WS) security framework, ensuring seamless profile caching and real-time synchronization between Agents and WS Services.

Key Functions:

✅ Dynamic Profile Updates – Maintains and updates the latest Agent profile cache efficiently to provide instant access to critical configurations.

✅ Seamless Configuration Synchronization – Serves as the core communication bridge, continuously syncing security policies and operational settings between Agents and WS Services.

✅ Optimized System Performance – Reduces latency by caching profiles locally while ensuring that Agents receive the most up-to-date configurations without unnecessary delays.

✅ Scalable & Secure Architecture – Enables robust, real-time updates across distributed environments while enforcing data integrity and security compliance.
